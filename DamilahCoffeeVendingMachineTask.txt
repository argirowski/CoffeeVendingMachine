ðŸŽ¯ Coffee Vending Machine Assignment
Build a small application for a Coffee Vending Machine with the following criteria:

ðŸ“Œ Requirements
âœ… Predefined Coffee Types
The vending machine should allow the user to pick from a predefined list of at least 5 coffee types (e.g., Latte, Macchiato, Espresso, Americano). Each coffee has its own characteristics (e.g., single dose of milk, one pack of sugar).

âœ… Internet Connectivity
The vending machine should connect to the internet, enabling the user to choose different types of coffee sourced from third-party systems (e.g., databases, APIs).

âœ… Customization Options
The vending machine should allow users to customize or enhance a basic coffee by adding predefined characteristics (e.g., sugar, creamer, more milk, caramel), making it possible to create unique types of coffee.

ðŸ“Œ Technical Requirement Information
âœ” Demonstrate your understanding of software design best practices and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Follow SOLID principles to produce well-structured and maintainable code.
âœ” Write the application as a Console C# application. Alternatively, feel free to use a UI technology of your choice.
âœ” Use a database or data source (e.g., API, JSON, XML) to cover the second requirement regarding coffee options from third-party sources.
âœ” For the customization feature, choose and implement an appropriate Design Pattern.

ðŸ“Œ Additional Points to Cover
âœ” Cover the main application logic with Unit Tests. Implementation of additional test types (e.g., Integration, API) will be considered a plus.
âœ” Describe the technologies you would use if building a real-life application.
âœ” Specify which cloud services you would use for a real-life application (preferred cloud provider: Azure).
